scalarTransportModel command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in scalarTransportProperties dictionary. A variety of derived classes exist that implement different physics of the scalarTransportModel. If no scalar transport shall be used, use the model 'none'.

scalarTransportModel model; :pre

model = name of the scalarTransportModel to be applied :ul

[Examples:]

scalarTransportModel generalManual; :pre

Note: This examples list might not be complete - please look for other models (scalarTransportModel_XY) in this documentation.

[Description:]

Solves the advection-dispersion transport equation for a dilute scalar quantity in the fluid phase. fvOptions can be specified to model sources, etc. in the fluid phase. Exchange models with a particle phase can be included by including appropriate forceModels in couplingProperties.

[Restrictions:] none.

[Default:] none.

locateModel_engineSearchIB command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

locateModel engineIB;
engineIBProps
\{
    engineProps
    \{
        faceDecomp false;
        treeSearch false;
    \}
    zSplit value1;
    xySplit value2;
\}  :pre

{switch1} = time to start the averaging (default 0) :ulb,l
{switch2} = names of the finite volume scalar fields to be temporally averaged :l
{value1} = number of z-normal layers for satellite points :l
{value2} = number of satellite points in each layer :l
:ule

[Examples:]

locateModel engineIB;
engineIBProps
\{
    engineProps
    \{
        faceDecomp false;
        treeSearch false;
    \}
    zSplit 8;
    xySplit 16;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The locateModel "engine" locates the CFD cell and cellID corresponding to a given position. This locate model is especially designed for parallel immersed boundary method. Each particle is represented by "satellite points" if it is distributed over several processors.

The engineSearchIB locate Model can be used with different settings to use different algorithms:

faceDecomp false; treeSearch false;     will execute some geometric (linear) search using the last known cellID (recommended) :ulb,l
faceDecomp false; treeSearch true;      will use a recursive tree structure to find the cell. :l
:ule


[Restrictions:] 

Only for immersed boundary solvers!

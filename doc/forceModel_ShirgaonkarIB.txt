forceModels
(
    SchirgaonkarIB
);
SchirgaonkarIBProps
\{
    velFieldName "U";
    densityFieldName "density";
    pressureFieldName "pressure";
\}; :pre

{density} = name of the finite volume density field :l
{pressure} = name of the finite volume pressure field :l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels

    SchirgaonkarIB
);
SchirgaonkarIBProps
\{
    velFieldName "U";
    densityFieldName "rho";
    pressureFieldName "p";
\} :pre

[Description:]

The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. The SchirgaonkarIB model calculates the drag force (viscous and pressure force) acting on each particle in a resolved manner (see Shirgaonkar et al. (2009): "A new mathematical formulation and fast algorithm for fully resolved simulation of self-propulsion", Journal of Comp. Physics). This model is only suited for resolved CFD-DEM simulations where the particle is represented by immersed boundrary method.

[Restrictions:]

Only for immersed boundary solvers.

forceModel_ShirgaonkarIB command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

forceModels
(
    ShirgaonkarIB
);
ShirgaonkarIBProps
\{
    velFieldName "U";
    pressureFieldName "p";
    twoDimensional;
    depth scalar1;
    verbose switch1;
    treatForceExplicit switch2;
\}; :pre

{U} = name of the finite volume fluid velocity field :ulb,l
{p} = name of the finite volume pressure field :l
{twoDimensional} = optional keyword for conducting a two dimensional calculation :l
{scalar1} = optional, only necessary if twoDimensional is active :l
{switch1} = (optional, default false) sub model switch, see "forceSubModel"_forceSubModel.html for details :l
{switch2} = (optional, default false) sub model switch, see "forceSubModel"_forceSubModel.html for details :l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    ShirgaonkarIB
);
ShirgaonkarIBProps
\{
    velFieldName "U";
    pressureFieldName "p";
\} :pre

[Description:]

The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. The ShirgaonkarIB model calculates the drag force (viscous and pressure force) acting on each particle in a resolved manner (see Shirgaonkar et al. (2009): "A new mathematical formulation and fast algorithm for fully resolved simulation of self-propulsion", Journal of Comp. Physics). This model is only suited for resolved CFD-DEM simulations where the particle is represented by immersed boundary method.

[Restrictions:]

Only for immersed boundary solvers.

clockModel standardClock; :pre

clockModel standardClock; :pre

[Description:]

The "standardClock" model is a basic clockModel model which measures the run time between every ".start(name)" and ".stop()" statement placed in the code. If a ".start(name)" is called more than once (e.g. in a loop) the accumulated times are calculated.  After the simulation has finished, the data is stored in $caseDir/CFD/clockData/$startTime/*.txt .

[Restrictions:] none.

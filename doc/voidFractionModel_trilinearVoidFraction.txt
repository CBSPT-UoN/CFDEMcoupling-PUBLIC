voidfractionModel_trilinearVoidFraction command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

voidfractionModel trilinear;
trilinearProps
\{
    alphaMin number1;
\} :pre

{number1} = minimum limit for voidfraction :ulb,l
:ule

[Examples:]

voidfractionModel trilinear;
trilinearProps
\{
    alphaMin 0.3;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The trilinear voidFraction model is supposed to be used when a particle (or its representation) is in the size range of a CFD cell. The particle's volume is distributed over 8 neighbouring cell centres usind trilinear interpolation. This allows for a very smooth transition of particle volume when a particle travels from one cell to another cell.

[Restrictions:] The model works only for a structured mesh with equal cubic cells and a clean x/y/z parallel distribution of the cells. WARNING: the alphaMin parameter is not yet considered in the model!!!

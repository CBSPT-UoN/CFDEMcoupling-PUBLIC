probeModel_particleProbe command :h3

[Syntax:]

To be activated via couplingProperties dictionary.

forceModels
(
    myForceModel1
    myForceModel2
    myForceModel3
);

probeModel particleProbe; 

particleProbeProps
\{
    particleIDsToSample (ID1 ID2 ID3 ...);  //list of particleIDs to sample
    verboseToFile;                          //main switch
    verbose;                                //currently not used
    printEvery       xEvery;                //print every this many CFD time steps
    printOnlyAtStep  xStep;                 //print only at this CFD time step (overrides "printEvery")
    sampleAll;                              //Activate sampling for all particles
    probeDebug;                             //probes additional fields
    includePosition;                        //will include particle position in the output file
    writePrecision xPrecision;              //number of significant digits to print
\}; :pre

{particleIDsToSample} = list of particle IDs to be sampled. :ulb,l

{myForceModeli} = list of force models in the simulation, the particleProbe will be applied to all of these models! :l
{verboseToFile} = main switch to activate the particle probe (default = off). :l
{verbose} = main switch to activate output to Info (currently not implemented). :l
{xEvery} = integer to specify the interval for sampling (default = 1, i.e., probing occurs every CFD time step). :l
{xStep}  = integer to specify the step for sampling (default = deactivated, i.e., it will print accordingly to "printEvery"). :l 
{sampleAll} = switch to activate sampling of all particles. Otherwise (default) only particles specified via "particleIDsToSample" in the couplingProperties dictionary will be sampled. :l

{probeDebug} = switch to activate probing of debug properties of secondary importance (specific for each force model). :l
{includePosition} = switch to add the particle position in the log file (default = off). :l
{xPrecision}= number of significant digits of the text output (default = 3). :l
:ule

[Examples:]

particleIDsToSample (0 1 2 3);
forceModels
(
    gradPForce
);
particleProbeProps
\{
    verboseToFile;       //main switch
    verbose;                //currently not used
    printEvery  100;      //print every this many CFD time steps
    sampleAll;            //Activate sampling for all particles
    probeDebug;  //probes additional fields
    includePosition;  //will include particle position in the output file
    writePrecision 4;           //number of significant digits to print
\}; :pre

Note: This examples list might not be complete - please check below for the list of force models that can perform particle probing.

[Description:]

The particleProbe feature keeps track of per-particle quantities (e.g., the fluid-particle interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle, and handles its storage during the simulation. Data is saved in the CFD/particleProbes/startTime directory, where startTime is the time at which the simulation is started (this avoids unwanted deletion of particleProbe data).

[Restrictions:]

You can manually switch off the probe model for each force model by specifying the Switch "suppressProbe" in the corresponding force properties dictionary.

[Default:] none.

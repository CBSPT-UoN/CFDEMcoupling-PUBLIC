cfdemSolverIB command :h3

[Description:]

"cfdemSolverIB" is a coupled CFD-DEM solver using CFDEMcoupling, an open source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework, for calculating
the dynamics between immersed bodies and the surrounding fluid. Being an implementation of an immersed boundary method it allows tackling problems where the body diameter exceeds the maximal size of a fluid cell. Usung the toolbox of OpenFOAM(R)(*) the governing equations of the fluid are computed and the corrections of velocity and pressure field with respect to the body-movement information, gained from LIGGGHTS, are incorporated.

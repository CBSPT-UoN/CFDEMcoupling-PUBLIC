forceModel_noDrag command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

forceModels
(
    noDrag
); :pre
noDragProps
\{
    noDEMForce "switch1";
    keepCFDForce "switch2";
    treatForceExplicit "switch3";
\}

{switch1} = (optional, default false) do not apply the previously calculated forces in DEM integration :ulb,l
{switch2} = (optional, default false) do not delete the previously calculated forces and use them in CFD source terms :l
{switch3} = (optional, default false) sub model switch, see "forceSubModel"_forceSubModel.html for details :l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    noDrag
); :pre

noDragProps
\{
    noDEMForce true; 
    keepCFDForce false; 
\}; :pre

[Description:]

The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. The noDrag model sets the forces acting on the particle (which were previously caclulated) to zero. If several force models are selected and noDrag is the last model being executed, the fluid particle force will be set to zero. If the variable noDEMForce is set, then the forces communicated to the DEM solver are also set to zero.

[Restrictions:]

None.

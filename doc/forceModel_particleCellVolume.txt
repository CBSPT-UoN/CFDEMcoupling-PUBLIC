forceModel_particleCellVolume command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

forceModels
(
    particleCellVolume
);
particleCellVolumeProps
\{
    verbose switch1;
    writeToFile switch2;
    startTime number1;
    upperThreshold number2;
    lowerThreshold number3;
    verbose;
\}; :pre

{switch1} = (optional, default true) switch for output to screen :ulb,l
{switch2} = (optional, default false) switch for output to file :l
{number1} = (optional, default 0) start time of volume calculation and output :l
{number2} = only cells with a field value (magnitude) lower than this upper threshold are considered :l
{number3} = only cells with a field value (magnitude) greater than this lower threshold are considered :l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    particleCellVolume
);
particleCellVolumeProps
\{
    upperThreshold 0.999;
    lowerThreshold 0;
\} :pre

[Description:]

This "forceModel" does not influence the particles or the simulation - it is a postprocessing tool! The total volume of the particles as they are represented on the CFD mesh is calculated. Further the total volume of the cells particles are in is calculated.
At "writeTime" a field named particleCellVolume , where scalarField is the name of the original field, is written. This can then be probed using standard function object probes. Analogously a field named cellVolume is written. Using the verbose option a screen output is given.

[Restrictions:]

None.
